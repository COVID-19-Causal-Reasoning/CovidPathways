# Immune Modulation by Heme and Tryptophan Catabolism

## Map description

Heme catabolism begins with heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), the enzyme responsible for cleaving heme into biliverdin (BV), carbon monoxide (CO), and ferrous iron (Fe2+) [PMID: 26166253, PMID: 31827672, PMID: 30013453, DOI: 10.3389/fphar.2019.00825]. BV is converted to Bilirubin (BR), and Fe2+ is sequestered and converted to ferric iron (Fe3+) by ferritin [DOI: 10.3389/fphar.2019.00825].  Accumulation of free iron can trigger ferroptosis, a form of programmed cell death [PMID: 30692038]. HO-1 expression is regulated by NRF-2. Under stressful conditions, NRF-2 is stabilized and translocates to the nucleus to activate an arsenal of cytoprotective genes [PMID: 20173742, PMID: 30692038].

HO-1 is a recognized immuno-protective agent in many disease types [PMID: 15451051, DOI: 10.3389/fphar.2019.00825]. Polymorphisms in (GT)n repeat length at the HO-1 promoter affect HO-1 expression, and are associated with comorbidities frequently observed in severe cases of COVID-19, including diabetes and various cardiovascular diseases [DOI: 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2004.07.008, PMID: 27473828, PMID: 20682519]. These polymorphisms have even been linked to predisposition for ARDS, a leading cause of death in COVID-19 patients [PMID: 19526221].

Indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO-1) is the rate limiting enzyme in the conversion of tryptophan to kynurenines, which modulate the immune response. L-kynurenine is a substrate for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a ligand activated transcription factor that promotes the generation of regulatory T cells to calm hyperinflammation [PMID: 249307]. Tryptophan scarcity also inhibits T cell proliferation. Downstream kynurenines 3-hydroxyanthralinic acid (3-HA) and quinolinic acid induce apoptosis in a subset of thymocytes in a manner comparable to the effect of dexamethasone, a steroid which has recently shown efficacy in improving survival in COVID-19 patients requiring oxygen or mechanical ventilation [PMID: 16709834, PMID: 12232796 , RECOVERY Trial Press Release]. Interestingly, a preprint by Thomas et.al. reported significantly higher kynurenine pathway activity based on serum metabolomics from COVID-19 positive patients relative to healthy controls, highlighting this pathwayâ€™s relevance to the disease [DOI: 10.1101/2020.05.14.20102491].

Expression of both IDO-1 and HO-1, as well as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) can be induced by the inflammatory cytokine IFN-g. IDO-1 expression is inhibited, whereas HO-1 expression and activity are enhanced, by cytotoxic nitric oxide (NO) produced by iNOS [DOI: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.06.061, PMID: 7514170]. 3-HA produced by IDO-1 inhibits NO production by enhancing expression of HO-1, however the mechanism by which this inhibits iNOS is not fully elucidated. One theory is that CO produced by HO-1 inhibits the transcription factor NF-KB, which is essential to iNOS expression [DOI: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.06.061].  


## Cross-talk with other pathways (in the map, and in general)

Hyperinflammation is a known complication in COVID-19, causing widespread damage, organ failure and death. An article from Quartuccio et. al. echoes the importance of targeting inflammation to prevent the onset of the catastrophic cytokine storm and ARDS [PMID: 32321634]. The immunomodulatory properties of heme and tryptophan catabolism present an opportunity to target the hyperactive immune environment. HO-1 can be pharmacologically induced, making this an attractive prospect for further study. Multiple animal models, including non-human primates, have demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties of CO produced by HO-1, leading researchers to explore the potential of inhaled or CORM-administered CO as a therapeutic [DOI: 10.3390/ma12101643]. A phase I clinical trial of low dose carbon monoxide in patients with sepsis-induced ARDS confirmed the safety and feasibility of this therapy in humans, though further investigation is still needed [PMID: 31137526, PMID: 30518685, DOI: 10.1152/ajplung.00366.2009, DOI: 10.4049/jimmunol.1202969]. HO-1 can also be induced by Panhematin (hemin), or Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) [PMID: 32132672, DOI: 10.3389/fphar.2019.00825, DOI: 10.1155/2018/9413876].

This pathway may overlap with the following existing disease map pathways: Orf3a Interactions, the Impact of Nsp14 on Metabolism, the Apoptosis pathway, the ER Stress pathway, and the Interferon pathway. An interaction between HO-1 and Orf3a were identified in the SARS-CoV-2 host protein interactome published by Gordon et. al., however the nature of this interaction is unknown [PMID: 32353859]. Nicotinamide synthesis, which is represented in the Nsp14 pathway, occurs downstream of the tryptophan metabolite 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate semialdehyde. The ER stress pathway may also be relevant to heme and tryptophan catabolism, as HO-1 was shown to modulate proapoptotic Bcl-2 and ER stress pathways in a mouse model of sepsis-induced ALI [DOI: 10.1155/2018/9413876]. There may also be overlap with the interferon pathway, however the heme/tryptophan pathway is more involved with interferon-gamma as opposed to interferons -alpha and -beta. Other general pathways that would help to contextualize this pathway are high level curation of the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2, initiation of the cytokine storm, detailed iron homeostasis, and T-cell differentiation.
