# SARS-CoV-2 Orf3a protein interactions

## Map description
ORF3a is the largest of the SARS-CoV accessory proteins at 274 amino acids in length with a native molecular weight of 31 kDa[1]. Orf3a with HOPS complex modify endomembrane compartments to favor coronavirus replication[2]IRF3, IL1A and TNFRSF1A receptor complex activate another complex which is containing IKBKG, IKBKB, and CHUK. For the activation of ininflammasome SARS-CoV unregulated the expression of pro-IL-1β transcription the result NF-κB activates. Two mechanisms introduce firstly Orf3a, and E proteins, leading to NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. ORF3a promotes ASC ubiquitination and consequent assembly of inflammasome.  Second Orf8b interacts activates NLRP3 leads to proteolytic cleavage of pro-caspase 1 and pro-IL-1β[3]. TRAF3 also play a vital role to activate ininflammasome Orf3a interacts with TRAF3 to activate NF-kB, resulting in transcription of IL-1b. ORF3a interacts with TRAF3 to promote ASC ubiquitination, leading to activation of caspase 1 and IL-1b [4].TRIM59 regulate antiviral innate immune signaling and are usurped by Orf3a. TRIM59 negatively regulates NF-κB and IRF-3/7-mediated signal pathways[2]. TRAF6, activating protein (TAB) 2/3 recruits the critical kinase TAK1 to enable the active of NF-_kB essential modulator , the regulatory domain of inhibitor of NF-kB . Tripartite motifs (TRIMs) play an integral role in the positive and negative regulation of antiviral pathways[5].

## Cross-talk with other pathways

TLR3, 7, 8 and 9, detect viral RNA and DNA in the endosome, whereas RLRs bind to viral RNA in the cytoplasm[6]. TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9, induces antiviral responses by producing interferon-α (IFN-α). Production of IFN-α is dependent on the Toll–interleukin-1 receptor domain–containing adaptor MyD88.[7] TRAF3 is required for TRIF-dependent activation. Internalized TLR4 recruits TRAF3 and TRAF6 to active endosomes via TRIF. TRAF6 mediates MyD88- and TRIF-induced activation of NF-κB1. TRAF6 bind to TAB2/3 to activate to NEMO to activate IKKα/β in the receptor complex[8]. TRIM23 knockdown decreased IFNβ production with SV infection in the cell.TRIM23-NEMO complexes is important for antiviral responses[9]. TRIM38 as a negative feedback regulator for TLR-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines by targeting TRAF6[10]. TRIM30α promoted the degradation of TAB2 and TAB3 and inhibited NF-κB activation induced by TLR signaling[11]. TRIM29 inhibited interferon-regulatory factors and signaling via the transcription factor NF-κB by degrading the adaptor NEMO and that TRIM29 directly bound NEMO and subsequently induced its ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation[12]. TRIM22 inhibits Tab2/3 complex independently of its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and NF-κB responsive long terminal repeat elements[13]. TRIM27 inhibits VSV infection-induced type I IFN production by promoting TBK1 degradation[14]. Overexpression of TRIM21 inhibited the activity of the IFNB1[15]. TRIM14 as a Positive Regulator of the Type I IFN Response[16]. βTrCP E3 complex and targeted for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation, releasing the NF-κB[17]. TRIM39 negatively regulates the NFκB-mediated signaling pathway through stabilization of Cactin[18]
