Leveraging COVID-19 Disease Maps for Counterfactual Inference of viral pathogenesis.

We are interested in leveraging domain knowledge contained in COVID-19
Disease Maps to enable three kinds of reasoning, collectively known as
Pearl's Causal Hierarchy~\cite{bareinboim_2020}. The least expressive
kind of reasoning is associational, which enables the ability to learn
from data to answer questions such as "Given that we know a patient
has COVID-19, would gaining information about her pre-existing
conditions give us new information about her chances of survival?"
The second level of the hierarchy is interventional, which enables the
ability to learn from data to answer questions such as "Given that a
patient has COVID-19, would treating her with Tocilizumab alter her
chances of survival?" The third level of the hierarchy is
counterfactual, which enables the ability to learn from data to answer
questions such as "Given that I treated this COVID-19 patient with
Tocilizumab and she lived, what are the chances that she would have
died had I not treated her?"

What enables this ability to reason at all three levels of the causal
hierarchy is a formalism known as a Structural Causal Model (SCM)~\cite{pearl_2009}. An SCM represents domain knowledge in terms of causal
diagrams, assumes a probability distribution over exogenous variables,
and assigns deterministic functions to endogenous variables. Because
the probability distribution over exogenous variables induces a
probability distribution over endogenous variables, an SCM can answer
associational level questions by using information about one
endogenous variable to compute a posterior distribution on another
endogenous variable. The action of replacing an endogenous variable's
function with a fixed value enables the ability to learn from data to
answer interventional level questions, and the process of using
evidence to abduce a posterior distribution on exogenous variables
followed by the action of fixing an endogenous variable enables the
ability to answer counterfactual level questions.

In order to leverage the COVID-19 Disease Maps,~\cite{ostaszewski_2020}, we
are developing tools to translate a disease map into an SCM.  We have
recently developed an algorithm (BEL2SCM) that automatically converts
knowledge represented in the Biological Expression Language (BEL)~\cite{slater_2014} to an SCM~\cite{Zucker_2020}.
This same algorithm will work just as effectively with knowledge represented in the Systems
Biology Graphical Notation Activity Flow (SBGN-AF)~\cite{mi_2015}.  We are
also leveraging the ODE2SCM~\cite{ness_2019} methodology to generate
an SCM for any ordinary or stochastic differential equation
represented in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML)~\cite{hucka_2003}. Lastly, using the CASQ methodology~\cite{aghamiri_2020}, it is
possible to convert a disease map represented in Systems Biology
Graphical Notation Process Description (SBGN-PD)~\cite{moodie_2015} to SBML
Qualitative models (SBML-Qual)~\cite{chaouiya_2013}, and we are now
developing a tool to convert an SBML-Qual model to an SCM (QUAL2SCM).

abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Molecular interaction maps have emerged as a meaningful way of representing biological mechanisms in a comprehensive and systematic manner. However, their static nature provides limited insights to the emerging behavior of the described biological system under different conditions. Computational modelling provides the means to study dynamic properties through in silico simulations and perturbations. We aim to bridge the gap between static and dynamic representations of biological systems with {CaSQ}, a software tool that infers Boolean rules based on the topology and semantics of molecular interaction maps built with {CellDesigner}. {RESULTS}: We developed {CaSQ} by defining conversion rules and logical formulas for inferred Boolean models according to the topology and the annotations of the starting molecular interaction maps. We used {CaSQ} to produce executable files of existing molecular maps that differ in size, complexity and the use of {SBGN} standards. We also compared, where possible, the manually built logical models corresponding to a molecular map to the ones inferred by {CaSQ}. The tool is able to process large and complex maps built with {CellDesigner} (either following {SBGN} standards or not) and produce Boolean models in a standard output format, {SBML}-qual, that can be further analyzed using popular modelling tools. References, annotations and layout of the {CellDesigner} molecular map are retained in the obtained model, facilitating interoperability and model reusability. {AVAILABILITY}: The present tool is available online: https://lifeware.inria.fr/∼soliman/post/casq/ and distributed as a Python package under the {GNU} {GPLv3} license.

abstract = {Cause and effect relationships play a central role in how we perceive and make sense of the world around us, how we act upon it, and ultimately, how we understand ourselves. Almost two decades ago, computer scientist Judea Pearl made a breakthrough in understanding causality by discovering and systematically studying the {\textquotedblleftLadder} of Causation\textquotedblright [Pearl and Mackenzie 2018], a framework that highlights the distinct roles of seeing,doing, and imagining. In honor of this landmark discovery, we name this the Pearl Causal Hierarchy ({PCH}). In this chapter, we develop a novel and comprehensive treatment of the {PCH} through two complementary lenses, one logical-probabilistic and another inferential graphical. Following Pearl\textquoterights own presentation of the hierarchy, we begin by showing how the {PCH} organically emerges from a well-specified collection of causal mechanisms (a structural causal model, or {SCM}). We then turn to the logical lens. Our first result, the Causal Hierarchy Theorem ({CHT}), demonstrates that the three layers of the hierarchy almost always separate in a measure-theoretic sense. Roughly speaking, the {CHT} says that data at one layer virtually always underdetermines information at higher layers. Since in most practical settings the scientist does not have access to the precise form of the underlying causal mechanisms– only to data generated by them with respect to some of {PCH\textquoterights} layers – this motivates us to study inferences within the {PCH} through the graphical lens. Specifically, we explore a set of methods known as causal inference that enable inferences bridging {PCH\textquoterights} layers given a partial specification of the {SCM}. For instance, one may want to infer what would happen had an intervention been performed in the environment (second-layer statement) when only passive observations (first-layer data) are available. We introduce a family of graphical models that allows the scientist to represent such a partial specification of the {SCM} in a cognitively meaningful and parsimonious way. Finally, we investigate an inferential system known as do calculus, showing how it can be sufficient, and in many cases necessary, to allow inferences across {PCH\textquoterights} layers. We believe that connecting with the essential dimensions of human experience as delineated by the {PCH} is a critical step towards creating the next generation of {AI} systems that will be safe, robust, human-compatible, and aligned with the social good.}

abstract = {Written by one of the preeminent researchers in the field, this book provides a comprehensive exposition of modern analysis of causation. It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, economics, philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social sciences. Judea Pearl presents and unifies the probabilistic, manipulative, counterfactual, and structural approaches to causation and devises simple mathematical tools for studying the relationships between causal connections and statistical associations. The book will open the way for including causal analysis in the standard curricula of statistics, artificial intelligence, business, epidemiology, social sciences, and economics. Students in these fields will find natural models, simple inferential procedures, and precise mathematical definitions of causal concepts that traditional texts have evaded or made unduly complicated. The first edition of Causality has led to a paradigmatic change in the way that causality is treated in statistics, philosophy, computer science, social science, and economics. Cited in more than 3,000 scientific publications, it continues to liberate scientists from the traditional molds of statistical thinking. In this revised edition, Judea Pearl elucidates thorny issues, answers readers' questions, and offers a panoramic view of recent advances in this field of research. Causality will be of interests to students and professionals in a wide variety of fields. Anyone who wishes to elucidate meaningful relationships from data, predict effects of actions and policies, assess explanations of reported events, or form theories of causal understanding and causal speech will find this book stimulating and invaluable.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Qualitative frameworks, especially those based on the logical discrete formalism, are increasingly used to model regulatory and signalling networks. A major advantage of these frameworks is that they do not require precise quantitative data, and that they are well-suited for studies of large networks. While numerous groups have developed specific computational tools that provide original methods to analyse qualitative models, a standard format to exchange qualitative models has been missing. {RESULTS}: We present the Systems Biology Markup Language ({SBML}) Qualitative Models Package ("qual"), an extension of the {SBML} Level 3 standard designed for computer representation of qualitative models of biological networks. We demonstrate the interoperability of models via {SBML} qual through the analysis of a specific signalling network by three independent software tools. Furthermore, the collective effort to define the {SBML} qual format paved the way for the development of {LogicalModel}, an open-source model library, which will facilitate the adoption of the format as well as the collaborative development of algorithms to analyse qualitative models. {CONCLUSIONS}: {SBML} qual allows the exchange of qualitative models among a number of complementary software tools. {SBML} qual has the potential to promote collaborative work on the development of novel computational approaches, as well as on the specification and the analysis of comprehensive qualitative models of regulatory and signalling networks.}
