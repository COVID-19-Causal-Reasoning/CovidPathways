Retrospective studies indicate that high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine Interleukin 6 are strongly associated with severely ill COVID-19 patients~\cite{ulhaq_2020}.
One recently proposed explanation for this observation is the viral induction of a positive feedback loop, known as Interleukin 6 Amplifier (IL6-AMP)~\cite{hirano_2020}.
IL6-AMP is stimulated by simultaneous activation of NF-kB and STAT~\cite{murakami_2012}.
This in turn induces various pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including Interleukin 6, which recruit activated T cells and macrophages.
This strengthens the IL6 amplifier into a positive feedback loop leading to a cytokine storm~\cite{ogura2008interleukin}, which is believed to be responsible for the tissue damage observed in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome~\cite{hirano_2020}. 

\medskip \noindent {\textbf{Intervention}}
Originally developed to treat autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis~\cite{oldfield_2009},
Tocilizumab is an antibody that targets the soluble IL6 receptor (SIL6R) and can effectively block the IL6 signal transduction pathway~\cite{zhang_2020}.
Tocilizumab has emerged as a promising drug repurposing candidate to reduce mortality in severely ill COVID-19 patients~\cite{coomes_2020,xaoling_2020}.
